SELECT * FROM `users`
SELECT user_login FROM users

SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 1
-- Will show only the number requested after "LIMIT" 

SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 2 OFFSET 5
--will show the limit number but skip the first x number established by the offset. Useful for pagination, or # of results shown on a screen before going to next page

SELECT * FROM `users` ORDER BY user_email
--ORDER BY sorts the table

SELECT * FROM `users` ORDER BY `users`.`user_email` ASC
--sorts user_email in ascending order. The dot notation specifies the object and child.

SELECT * FROM products WHERE price = 11.99
--WHERE clause sorts data by an argument. will return products with a price of 11.99
-- = equality 
-- <> non-equality 
-- != non-equality 
-- < less than 
-- <= less than or equal 
-- > greater than 
-- >= greater than or equal 
-- !> not greater than 
-- BETWEEN 
-- IS NULL 
-- AND 
-- OR

SELECT * FROM products WHERE author = "Yuval Noah Harari" AND price >16.00
-- AND allows stringing arguments to get precise results. OR operates similarly

--LIKE
SELECT * FROM products WHERE author LIKE "%Miller%"
--if we do WHERE auther = "Miller", we will return no results because we are over specific. If we use LIKE and the will card % characters we tell mySQL to search for results that are also close or similar. % on the left only will put a wild card on the left side only. Can you give slightly tighter search results.

AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS
AVG() 
COUNT()
MAX()
MIN()
SUM()

--example
SELECT SUM(price*quantity) FROM products



QUIZ

--find the state drink of Maine
SELECT * FROM `states` WHERE state = "Maine"
--returns the row in states for Maine

SELECT COUNT(drink="Milk") FROM `states`
--returns 29. the number of states where the state drink is milk
SELECT COUNT(drink) FROM `states` WHERE drink = "Milk"
--returns 19. The correct number.

SELECT * FROM `states` WHERE drink="Milk"
--returns all rows where the state drink is Milk

SELECT * FROM `states` ORDER BY year LIMIT 1
--sorts the list in ascending order by year. then limits search results to 1 row.





--UPDATE
UPDATE states SET drink = "Chocolate Oat Milk" WHERE state = "Delaware"
--updates the drink for Delaware

--can also write like this
UPDATE states 
SET drink = "Chocolate Oat Milk" 
WHERE state = "Delaware"



--DELETE
DELETE FROM states 
WHERE state = "Florida"

--CRUD
C — Create
R — Read
U — Update
D — Delete

SQL Datatypes 
Here are some of the more common datatypes that you'll be using in your database whether it's MYSQL, SQL Server, or Oracle. 

TINYINT(Size)
A very small integer. Signed range is from -128 to 127. Unsigned range is from 0 to 255. "Size" specifies the maximum display width (which is 255)

INT(Size)
A medium integer. Signed range is from -2147483648 to 2147483647. Unsigned range is from 0 to 4294967295. "Size" specifies the maximum display width (which is 255).

BIGINT(Size)
A large integer. Signed range is from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807. Unsigned range is from 0 to 1844674407370955

VARCHAR(256)
A VARIABLE length string that can contain letters, numbers, and special characters. The length can be from 0 to 65535

LONGTEXT
A string with up to 4,294,967,295 characters

DECIMAL(size, d)
"Size" is the total number of digitals. "d" is the number of digits after the decimal point. The maximum number for size is 65. The maximum number for d is 30. The default value for size is 10. The default value for d is 0. For money, a suitable recommendation is to use DECIMAL(10, 2)

DATETIME
Used to set the date, Google instructions for more info on this!

TIMESTAMP
The current timestamp (in UNIX time) when the row was created.

--ALIAS
SELECT p.post_title, u.user_nicename
FROM posts AS p
JOIN users 
AS u ON u.ID = p.post_author
-- AS, stands for alias, lets the user shortcut a prefix for faster querying and typing. for example here we set p as shortcut for posts

SELECT p.post_title as "Post Title", u.user_nicename, count(*) as "Total Posts"
FROM posts AS p
JOIN users 
AS u ON u.ID = p.post_author


--THIS QUERY RETURNS THE FIRST POST TITLE, AUTHOR NAME, AND TOTAL POSTS BY THAT AUTHOR. ANY_VALUE IS REQUIRED IN THE NEW MYSQL TO WORK AROUND THE GROUPY BY DEFAULT WHICH THROWS AN ERROR IF ANY_VALUE IS ABSENT FROM QUERY.
SELECT ANY_VALUE(p.post_title), ANY_VALUE(u.user_nicename), count(*) as "Total Posts" FROM posts AS p JOIN users AS u ON u.ID = p.post_author


JOIN
SELECT comments.*, posts.post_content
FROM comments
JOIN posts ON comments.post_ID=posts.ID

-- RETURNS A NEW TABLE WITH ALL THE COLUMNS FROM COMMENTS TABLE PLUS THE POST_CONTENT COLUMN FROM THE POSTS TABLE WHERE THE POST ID MATCHES UP BETWEEN THE TWO TABLES


--FULL OUTER JOIN
SELECT posts.post_title, comments.comment_content
FROM posts 
LEFT JOIN comments ON posts.ID = comments.post_id
UNION
SELECT posts.post_title, comments.comment_content
FROM posts 
RIGHT JOIN comments ON posts.ID = comments.post_id
-- This query is a hack to produce a full outer join where we grab everything on left and right side and unite them. This allows us to see all the posts and their associated comments, and all the comments and their associated posts. So we'll see which posts have zero comments, and which comments are orphaned.

--JOIN - takes two tables and adds columns in the resulting table to blend them together
--UNION - takes two tables and mashes them together. No blending


--UNION example
SELECT users.user_email
FROM users
UNION 
SELECT comments.comment_author_email
FROM comments
--this queries all the emails from users and from comments and combines them into one outputted list. Could use this to spam them all with corporate bullshit.

--GROUP BY
SELECT posts.post_title, COUNT(comments.ID)  as "# of Comments" 
FROM posts 
LEFT JOIN comments ON posts.ID = comments.post_ID
GROUP BY posts.ID
--this SQL query selects the posts titles, counts the comments and assigns them a new column title "# of comments" from the posts table. It then joins the comments that were tied to posts and groups them by post ID. The group by is needed since we have unaggregated data. The group by also tells teh count to run the count for each post. not for the sum of all comments. 

--Subquery and IN
SELECT users.user_email FROM users 
WHERE id IN (SELECT post_author FROM posts WHERE post_status = "draft")
--this queries all user emails and then runs a sub query to determine which users have drafted posts. It uses the id from the first query and matches it to the results from the sub query.

--alternate
SELECT users.user_email 
FROM users
JOIN posts ON posts.post_author = users.ID
WHERE posts.post_status = "draft"
--can also use JOIN and WHERE to achieve the same end result as the sub query

--IN
--IN tells the query where to search in a list.

--TRUNCATE and DROP
--TRUNCATE will delete the rows of any given table, but it keeps the table and headers
TRUNCATE facebook_users
--DROP
DROP TABLE facebook_users
-- deletes all rows and the entire table from the database.
